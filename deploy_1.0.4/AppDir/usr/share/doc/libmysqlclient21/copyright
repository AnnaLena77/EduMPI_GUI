 Quoting from LICENSE:

 This is a release of MySQL 8.0, brought to you by the MySQL team at
 Oracle. This software is released under version 2 of the GNU General
 Public License (GPLv2), as set forth below, with the following
 additional permissions:
 .
 This distribution of MySQL 8.0 is distributed with certain software
 (including but not limited to OpenSSL) that is licensed under separate
 terms, as designated in a particular file or component or in the
 license documentation. Without limiting your rights under the GPLv2,
 the authors of MySQL hereby grant you an additional permission to link
 the program and your derivative works with the separately licensed
 software that they have included with the program.
 .
 This distribution includes the MySQL C API client library
 (libmysqlclient) otherwise known as MySQL Connector/C. Without limiting
 the foregoing grant of rights under the GPLv2 and additional permission
 as to separately licensed software, this Connector is also subject to
 the Universal FOSS Exception, version 1.0, a copy of which is

 > The Universal FOSS Exception, Version 1.0
 > .
 > In addition to the rights set forth in the other license(s) included in the
 > distribution for this software, data, and/or documentation (collectively the
 > "Software," and such licenses collectively with this additional permission the
 > "Software License"), the copyright holders wish to facilitate interoperability
 > with other software, data, and/or documentation distributed with complete
 > corresponding source under a license that is OSI-approved and/or categorized
 > by the FSF as free (collectively "Other FOSS").  We therefore hereby grant the
 > following additional permission with respect to the use and distribution of
 > the Software with Other FOSS, and the constants, function signatures, data
 > structures and other invocation methods used to run or interact with each of
 > them (as to each, such software's "Interfaces"):
 > .
 > (i) The Software's Interfaces may, to the extent permitted by the license of
 > the Other FOSS, be copied into, used and distributed in the Other FOSS in
 > order to enable interoperability, without requiring a change to the license of
 > the Other FOSS other than as to any Interfaces of the Software embedded
 > therein.  The Software's Interfaces remain at all times under the Software
 > License, including without limitation as used in the Other FOSS (which upon
 > any such use also then contains a portion of the Software under the Software
 > License).
 > .
 > (ii) The Other FOSS's Interfaces may, to the extent permitted by the license
 > of the Other FOSS, be copied into, used and distributed in the Software in
 > order to enable interoperability, without requiring that such Interfaces be
 > licensed under the terms of the Software License or otherwise altering their
 > original terms, if this does not require any portion of the Software other
 > than such Interfaces to be licensed under the terms other than the Software
 > License.
 > .
 > (iii) If only Interfaces and no other code is copied between the Software and
 > the Other FOSS in either direction, the use and/or distribution of the
 > Software with the Other FOSS shall not be deemed to require that the Other
 > FOSS be licensed under the license of the Software, other than as to any
 > Interfaces of the Software copied into the Other FOSS.  This includes, by way
 > of example and without limitation, statically or dynamically linking the
 > Software together with Other FOSS after enabling interoperability using the
 > Interfaces of one or both, and distributing the resulting combination under
 > different licenses for the respective portions thereof.
 > .
 > For avoidance of doubt, a license which is OSI-approved or categorized by the
 > FSF as free, includes, for the purpose of this permission, such licenses with
 > additional permissions, and any license that has previously been so-approved
 > or categorized as free, even if now deprecated or otherwise no longer
 > recognized as approved or free.  Nothing in this additional permission grants
 > any right to distribute any portion of the Software on terms other than those
 > of the Software License or grants any additional permission of any kind for
 > use or distribution of the Software in conjunction with software other than
 > Other FOSS.

 Because of the number of inquiries I was receiving about the  use

 simply make it public domain to further its unrestricted use.	I
 specifically  would  be  most happy to see this material become a
 part of the standard Unix distributions by AT&T and the  Berkeley
 Computer  Science  Research Group, and a standard part of the GNU

 I would appreciate it, as a courtesy, if this notice is  left  in
 all copies and derivative works.  Thank you.
